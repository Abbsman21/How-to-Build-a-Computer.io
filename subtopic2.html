 site offers a basic entry-level guide to explaining what computer hardware is. It may be basic but, it provides a detailed insight into the fundamentals of hardware elements that are needed for the computer
to function and perform properly. This guide talks about the CPU, memory, storage devices, input/output devices, and networking aspects as well. The guide also makes clear the importance of hardware combability and selection criteria for different computing needs, and that means,
you have to make sure all the hardware parts can work with each other in harmony since there are a lot of different parts that look the same but are extremely different, one example would be RAM, now RAM may all look the same but not all can fit on your motherboard. Moving forward, this guide also
gives tips on troubleshooting and maintenance which are very important if something goes wrong when you are adjusting or putting in a new piece of hardware. In the end, this hardware guide is a very valuable resource for expanding your knowledge and improving your understanding of what each Computer part does. <br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;">This
site explores the importance of both hardware and software components in computer systems. It goes over the major role hardware plays in providing the foundation base for performing computer operations. The article goes over the basics of hardware parts such as the processors, memory, storage, and peripherals, it explains their contributions to the performance and basic functionality of computers. Now we may understand the hardware part but there is also another big part of computers which is the software, this refers to the programs and instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Software is considered intangible and it can't be "seen and touched". This is important because, without software, the hardware will not be able to perform basic tasks and communicate with each other. Overall, the article serves as an insightful exploration of how hardware and software work well together, and how difficult it would be if one  or the other wasn't working properly.  .&nbsp; <br>
